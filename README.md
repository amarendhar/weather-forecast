This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template.

Use `Node >= v14` to support all the new libraries such as `lint-staged`.
## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm run test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `npm run coverage`

To generate the coverage report.
### `npm run type-check`

To check typescript errors.

### `npm run lint-staged`

To run prettier & test-cases for the staged-files.

## Notes
  - For this application `redux-state-management` library is not necessary, as it doesn't require to maintain global-state across the pages, because it has only one page with an independent state from the respective API. But redux-library is installed & used to support the future requirements and to show the usage of the new `@reduxjs/toolkit`.
  - `Test-cases` are covered for all the components & utils, the coverage report can be generated by `npm run coverage`.
  - `Responsive-design` is enabled for WeatherReport component, which is simple & not a big change.
  - Added `accessibility` to navigate over the list of weather-reports by using keyboard with voiceover.
  - `Fonts` are used from suggested [Robot-Family](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto?selection.family=Roboto:400,700).
  - `Weather-icons` are used from suggested [gist-link](https://gist.github.com/interstellar-wormhole/f7bc42a3e59d0299bfa465e0652a634b). But weather icons can be used from [openweathermap](https://openweathermap.org/weather-conditions), according to the `response.list[index].weather[0].icon` values.
  - Added `loading-state` when fetching the data from [API](https://samples.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast?q=M%C3%BCnchen,DE&appid=b6907d289e10d714a6e88b30761fae22).
  - Handled `error-state` by rendering Retry-Component to retry, when API is failed.
  - Added `NotFound-Page` to goback to home-page, when navigated to routes which are not existed.
  - Added `kelvinToCelsius` util, but which is not required, when used the realtime-API with query-param `units=metric`, refer [openweathermap](https://openweathermap.org/forecast5) for more details.
  - Added `styled-components` npm, and created `ThemProvider` with them which has `space, fontSizes, fontWeights, radii, shadows, palette, breakpoints & mediaQueries`. Added GlobalStyles for Global-CSS.
  - Added `test-utils` for components & hooks.
  - Added [msw](https://mswjs.io/) to mock API's with mock-data for test-cases.
  - Added `jest-styled-components` to test css-rules.
  - Added [http-proxy-middleware](https://github.com/chimurai/http-proxy-middleware) and created `setupProxy.js` to resolve `CORS` issues.
  - Added `baseUrl` in tsconfig.json to use absolute-paths over relative-paths for importing.
  - Added `husky` to run `type-check & lint-staged` on every commit.
  - Re-installed all libraries with `node-v14.18.1` to support latest versions of libraries such as `lint-staged-v12.1.2`.
  - Added `type-check` to check for `type-errors`.
  - Added `prettier` to format the code.
  - redux-logger is installed to watch over store-updates in development mode.
